> [!NOTE]
> - A professional command-line tool for securing Python scripts through obfuscation, bytecode compilation, and secure backups. Built with a sleek terminal interface using ANSI colors for an enhanced user experience. Ideal for developers looking to protect their code on Android (e.g., Termux) or any Python environment.
<hr/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features ✨:
> 1. Obfuscation: Automatically minifies and renames variables in Python source code using python-minifier for added security before compilation. ✔️
> 2. Bytecode Compilation: Compiles obfuscated code to .pyc files for faster execution and basic protection against casual inspection. ✔️
> 3. Secure Backups: Creates timestamped backups of original files in a dedicated directory. ✔️
> 4. Decryption/Restore: Easily restore original files from backups with a simple stem-name input. ✔️
> 5. Auto-Dependency Installation: Installs required libraries (e.g., python-minifier) on first run via an interactive menu. ✔️
> 6. Real-Time Loading: Animated progress indicators for a polished, professional feel. ✔️
> 7. Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android (via Termux). ✔️
> 8. Error Handling: Robust try-catch blocks with colorful error messages. ✔️
<hr/>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Extra `encryption.zip` Then move `python.pyc` in the `TERMUX` directory.
> 2. Run `pkg update. && pkg install python`.
> 3. Open `TERMUX` then run `chmod +x python.pyc && python3 python.pyc`.
> 4. Run the `00` option first to install dependencies.
> 5. To run option 1, the file must be outside the folder in the `sdcard` directory, for example `/sdcard/example.py`.
> 6. The input option 1 is `example.py` ,which will generate a `.backup` file for the decryption part.
> 7. To run option 2 you only need to input the file name `example`, no need for `example.py.backup`.
<hr/>

> Dependencies
> - `Python 3.8+`.
> - pathlib `(standard library)`.
> - shutil, py_compile, subprocess `(standard library)`.
> - `python-minifier` (auto-installed via tool; for code obfuscation).
